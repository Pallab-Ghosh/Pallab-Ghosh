## 🚀 About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm Pallab, a passionate and dedicated software engineer with a strong background in both front-end and back-end development. My journey in technology has equipped me with a well-rounded perspective on problem-solving and innovation. I am proficient in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and skilled in building responsive, user-friendly interfaces with React, Next.js, and various UI libraries. My expertise extends to designing and implementing RESTful APIs, managing databases with Prisma and MongoDB, and developing cross-platform mobile applications using React Native.

I thrive on innovation, constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech landscape. I am a strong believer in teamwork and open communication, committed to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code, with a focus on quality and performance. Continuous learning is a core value of mine, and I am always eager to learn new skills and improve existing ones, believing that growth is a lifelong journey.

Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute to projects, or reach out for collaboration. Together, we can create something amazing!
